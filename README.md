# Domestic Violence and Firearm Use in Los Angeles County

## Introduction
Amid the unfolding Supreme Court case, Rahimi v United States, a pivotal question emerges: Does forbidding firearms possession by individuals under domestic violence restraining orders infringe upon the rights granted by the Second Amendment? In my capacity at the Public Health Institute, I have embarked on an exhaustive examination of existing scientific literature. This investigative endeavor aims to understand the intricate relationship between domestic violence restraining orders and the consequent removal or prohibition of firearm access. The culmination of this research will be a comprehensive policy brief. Through this brief, we aim to explain the implications of this relationship and offer well-founded policy recommendations to address the complexities inherent in balancing individual rights with public safety.

Drawing from my Population Analysis, Foundations of Data Science, and Biostatistics coursework, I embarked on a personal research project investigating the link between domestic violence and firearms. My central question was: How often do domestic violence incidents involving firearms happen in various neighborhoods? The goal was to pinpoint areas with high incidents of firearm-related domestic violence. I utilized Python for the data analysis, working with a CSV file detailing 911 calls from Los Angeles County. For mapping purposes, I employed a shapefile to define the precinct boundaries corresponding to the locations of the 911 calls.

## Process of Data Analysis

### Plan

To initiate the project focusing on Domestic Violence and Firearm Use, I first determined its precise scope. My thorough research revealed a notable lack of data centered on domestic violence within specific neighborhood settings. However, after diligent investigation, I secured a dataset from the Los Angeles Police Department that catered to our research inquiry. This project's primary stakeholders are organizations searching for accessible data visualizations to bolster their outreach efforts in mitigating domestic violence. 

### Analyze

After planning, I began to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA). This is where I cleaned, reorganized, and reformatted the data so there is no bias once communicating the results with stakeholders.

### Construct

Following the EDA, I crafted visual representations to identify data correlations. The goal was to uncover underlying patterns and relationships in the data.

### Execute 

During the execution phase, I'll present my findings to the primary stakeholders who stand to gain from this study. Based on the research, one major suggestion would be prioritizing real-world interventions in regions with heightened gun-related domestic violence. Additionally, there's a noticeable lack of data in certain areas; hence, gathering and disseminating this data is crucial for effective policy formulation.
